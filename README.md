🎵 Emotion-Aware Music Recommender System

A machine-learning based system that recommends music based on user’s facial expressions.

📌 Overview

This project identifies a user’s real-time emotional state using facial expressions and recommends music tracks that match or improve the user’s mood.

It integrates:

🎭 Emotion Detection (Deep Learning / CNN / OpenCV / FER)

🎶 Music Recommendation Engine

📱 User Interface (optional: Streamlit / Web app)

📂 Dataset Preprocessing + Model Training

🚀 Features

✔ Detects emotions in real-time from webcam
✔ Supports multiple emotions (Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, Surprise, Fear)
✔ Maps emotions to curated playlists
✔ Plays music automatically
✔ Fully customizable recommendation logic
✔ Easy to integrate with Spotify / YouTube APIs

🧠 Tech Stack

Python

OpenCV

TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch

📝 How It Works

Camera captures a frame

Deep learning model predicts facial emotion

System maps the emotion to a music category

Music recommender chooses the best track

Track plays automatically / is displayed in UI
